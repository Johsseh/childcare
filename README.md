This day care is for organizations that use manual information systems i.e. documenting their data in files. This project does that the organization requires a database system which pulls together information stored in a number of central and local systems. Information about the children is required (like their names, identification number, address, any health issues, parent contacts etc.)And this information is pulled in from the proposed database that is developed. The system is only be accessible by key members of the day care administration.
